1. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	when some other people commit or operate on my project , if pull
	everything , my local files would totally be messed up. 
	Do it manually, i have total control of managing my files

2. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?

	forks: used when you wanna clone someone's repository on github instead of cloning 
	into your local computer.

	Clones: clone the repository into your local computer.

	Branches: Make another version of the repository, all work done on this branch will
	not affect the master branch.
