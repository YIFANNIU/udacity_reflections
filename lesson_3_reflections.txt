1. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	when some other people commit or operate on my project , if pull
	everything , my local files would totally be messed up. 
	Do it manually, i have total control of managing my files

2. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?

	forks: used when you wanna clone someone's repository on github instead of cloning 
	into your local computer.

	Clones: clone the repository into your local computer.

	Branches: Make another version of the repository, all work done on this branch will
	not affect the master branch.

3. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	You will not forget to update it. when you run the command , it will always remind you.
	
4. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be
easier, and what would be harder?

	I need manually merge the file. Of course using git will be easier.
	Do it manually will be harder.

5. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than
directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	When many people work on the same project and all the change need to be
	checked by the master.

	Work on a separate branch help us be clear of any changes
	Work on the same master branch will be more convenience and efficient
